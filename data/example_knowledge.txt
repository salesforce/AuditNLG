23 Years of Salesforce News Highlights
The below timeline captures the history of Salesforce, including some key milestones along the way, illustrating our record of doing well while doing good.

Salesforce is the global leader in CRM, helping companies connect with customers in a whole new way. Founded in 1999, Salesforce enables companies of every size and industry to digitally transform around their customers by harnessing the power of automation, artificial intelligence, and real-time data to make every customer experience more personal, valuable and memorable. With a global community driven by shared core values, Salesforce is more than a business – it’s a platform for change.

1999
In February, the Salesforce journey begins with a clear vision to be “A World-Class Internet Company for Sales Force Automation.”
On March 8, Salesforce incorporates and Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff begin working on the first version of Salesforce’s CRM. Their base is a rented one-bedroom apartment at 1449 Montgomery Street, on San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill.
As the four develop their prototype, they also build a distinctive startup culture. They only work on what they believe is important and necessary, to do it “fast, simple, and right the first time.” “No fluff” is their mantra. They wear Hawaiian print shirts, brunch at Mama’s, appoint Marc’s dog Koa as Chief Love Officer, and constantly ask for feedback.
The company also writes its first V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures) strategic plan, aiming to provide employees with a clear vision and align the organization around common goals. In true startup fashion, the original draft is written on the back of an envelope. V2MOM remains at the core of how Salesforce runs its business, and continues to guide every decision the company makes.
By the end of its first year, the company has expanded to 40 employees and an 8,000-square-foot office at the Rincon Center.

‘Meatpistol’ presenters let go at Def Con

RAICES donation refusal

In July 2021, Salesforce Japan faced a discrimination lawsuit from a former employee, according to Japanese legal media,[128] at a time when the firm has been publicly challenged about its commitment to equality[citation needed]. The firm declined to comment on the suit to the media. The ex-employee, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD, claimed she was discriminated against because of her disability and terminated in the firm’s Japan web marketing team. The suit alleged that the anonymous woman, as an employee at Salesforce Japan from 2018 to 2020, faced hate speech, microaggressions and rejection of reasonable accommodation from the manager. She alleged that her attempts to resolve the problem were met with pressure from HR and job coach. The lawsuit started on September 15 in Tokyo district court. The 8th trial will open on November 14, 2022.[129][130]
